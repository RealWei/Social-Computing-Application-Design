Use bootstrap and toolkit mentioned above to build up the website.
First, search photos by tag in the search field (press enter to search), get basic information of photos with tag.
Then request photo detail by the photo id, show each photo as a card.
Click on image or the ":" button to reveal more information of the photo.
The page will scroll when results started to show, and each photo will fade in.

I saw TA mentioned lightbox in ilms forum.
To use it, I installed bootstrap and amazed by what it can do.
(But I didn't use lightbox in this assignment though.)
I didn't encounter too many problems, since this assignment is quite like a combination of Assignment 1 (todo list) and lab 5.
